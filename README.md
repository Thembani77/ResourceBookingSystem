🧠 **Booking Conflict Logic Explained**
When a new booking is created, the system checks for any overlapping bookings on the selected resource:
 
var hasConflict = await _context.Bookings.AnyAsync(b =>
    b.ResourceId == booking.ResourceId &&
    (
        (booking.StartTime >= b.StartTime && booking.StartTime < b.EndTime) ||
        (booking.EndTime > b.StartTime && booking.EndTime <= b.EndTime) ||
        (booking.StartTime <= b.StartTime && booking.EndTime >= b.EndTime)
    ));

---
🧱 **Database Setup**
Uses ApplicationDbContext with DbSet<Resource> and DbSet<Booking>.

Booking entity has a foreign key relationship with Resource.

Initial seed data for resources added in OnModelCreating.
